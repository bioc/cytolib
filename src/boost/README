bundle procedure:
simply copy source files from lib/filesystem and lib/system subfolders

old procedure:
extraction file system module from boost:
download boost_1_78
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 tools/bcp
mkdir foo
./dist/bin/bcp boost/filesystem foo/
(portion of submodules extracted by bcp xxx ./foo, can's use build files from bcp since it doesn't work somehow)
